Fifteen members of Forbes Technology Council (https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/09/27/15-business-applications-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/?sh=7ebf3292579f) discuss some of the latest applications they’ve found for AI/ML at their companies.

1. ***Powering infrastructure***. Solutions, and Services: They acquire an AI platform to power the next generation of chat and voice assistance.
2. ***Cybersecurity defense***. An AI aimed to constantly analyze their network packets and map out what is normal traffic. It is aware of over 102,000 patterns on our network.
3. ***Health care benefits***. We are exploring AI/ML technology for health care. It can help doctors with diagnoses and tell when patients are deteriorating so medical intervention can be sooner before the patient needs hospitalization.
4. ***Recruiting Automation***. By harnessing the power of recruiting automation, savvy employers are using AI-powered sourcing tools to find candidates who may not have been considered for roles in the past, not because they weren’t qualified, but because they weren’t surfaced in the first place.
5. ***Intelligent conversational interfaces***. These AI-driven conversational interfaces answer questions from frequently asked. Advances in deep learning are making many of these AI and ML applications possible.
6. ***Reduce Energy Use and Costs***. AI has been used to cut energy use, transportation of crude and natural gas, also refining operations. Also, we predict the load of energy and demand.
7. ***Predicting vulnerability exploitation***. The use of AI technology to predict vulnerability in a piece of software reduces the probability of attack.
8. ***Becoming more customer-centric***. AI-driven insights to analyze customer responses to surveys and activities over time. This enables them not only to understand the feedback they provide. Also, understand if some specific qualities and attributes correlate to their response rate likelihood to engage.
9. ***Market prediction***. We are using AI in many traditional places like personalization, intuitive workflows, enhanced searching, and product recommendations.
10. ***Accelerated reading***. AI is accelerating our understanding of written text.
11. ***Cross-layer resilience validation***. The validation technology goes beyond detecting what is broken now into predictive resilience risk detection.
12. ***Accounting and fintech***. AI is affecting different industries. AI to streamline their professional routines through practices like automated data entry and reporting.
13. ***Advance billing rules***. Identifying trends in declined credit cards (for example, cards being declined more often on Sunday evening compared to a Wednesday morning.
14. ***Understanding intentions and behaviors***. Bad actors follow specific communication patterns. Ai can understand the intention behind communications.
15. ***Proposal review***. Machine learning can analyze the scope, the pricing, and the contractor's historical performance to determine if the proposal is the right cost and will be done at the right quality level. 

McKinsey & Company predicts AI could potentially create a total annual value across all industries of about US$9.5 - US$15.4 trillion. The insurance industry could have a total annual value of up to US$1.1 trillion. Particularly for this last industry, the risk concept implies 91.4 billion 60.4 Billion driven by traditional AI and 31.1 Billion for advanced AI.

Traditional AI and analytics: (i) Machine Learning (Clustering), and (ii) Statistical techniques (i.e. basic regression). 
Advance AI and analytics: (i) Deep learning neural networks (convolutional neural networks), and (ii) Reinforcement learning.

There are three key components in AI-ML Jobs: 

1. Data
2. Model
3. Compute

There is a convergence happening between AI and Cloud Computing.
1. Today the data processing power requiered to train the ML/AI models are increasing at a fast pace, therefore we won't have the choice but to use the Cloud to build train threse models.
2. Thre are economies of scale, the cost of training these models using the Cloud is much lower than on-premises.
